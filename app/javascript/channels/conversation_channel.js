// app/javascript/channels/conversation_channel.js
import consumer from "./consumer"

// This channel definition is generally used when you subscribe directly here,
// or want to export a reference to the channel.
// However, since your Stimulus controller directly creates the subscription,
// this file effectively acts as a placeholder to ensure 'channels/conversation_channel'
// is recognized by Importmap and loaded via channels/index.js.

// If you *were* to subscribe here, it might look like this (but don't do this
// if your Stimulus controller is already subscribing to avoid duplicate subscriptions):
// export const conversationChannel = consumer.subscriptions.create("ConversationChannel", {
//   connected() {
//     // Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
//     console.log("ConversationChannel (from channels/conversation_channel.js) connected!");
//   },

//   disconnected() {
//     // Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
//     console.log("ConversationChannel (from channels/conversation_channel.js) disconnected!");
//   },

//   received(data) {
//     // Called when there's incoming data on the websocket for this channel
//     // If you were to use this, you'd likely dispatch an event or call a Stimulus method
//     // to update the UI.
//     console.log("Received data in channels/conversation_channel.js:", data);
//   }
// });

// For your setup, leaving it empty or just with the import statement is fine.
// The key is that `app/javascript/channels/index.js` imports it,
// ensuring Importmap knows about it.
